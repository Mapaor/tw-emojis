### Assets TW Emojis
Twitter emojis from [https://github.com/jdecked/twemoji](https://github.com/jdecked/twemoji) as svgs, and pngs for using on custom websites, mail signatures, or whatever.
- [svgs](./tw-emojis-svgs)
- [pngs](./tw-emojis-pngs)
TODO: I used Inkscape CLI to render the pngs from the svgs. But they rendered at 36x36. Now I've got to do it again to 128x128, which is better for emojis.
